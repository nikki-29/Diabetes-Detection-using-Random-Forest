# Diabetes-Detection-using-Random-Forest

Diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic life threatening diseases that have already affected  422  million people worldwide according to the report
of World Health Organization (WHO), in  2018 . Due to the presence of a relatively long asymptomatic phase, early detection of diabetes is always desired 
for a clinically meaningful outcome. Around  50 % of all people suffering from diabetes are undiagnosed because of its long-term asymptomatic phase. This 
project will help people in identifying diabetes at the earliest and take medications if they have diabetes.
