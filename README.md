# Diabetes Detection using Random-Forest

Diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic life threatening diseases that have already affected  422  million people worldwide according to the report
of World Health Organization (WHO), in  2018 . Due to the presence of a relatively long asymptomatic phase, early detection of diabetes is always desired 
for a clinically meaningful outcome. Around  50 % of all people suffering from diabetes are undiagnosed because of its long-term asymptomatic phase. This 
project will help people in identifying diabetes at the earliest and take medications if they have diabetes.

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.
There isn’t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help

# Goal of this Project

The goal of this project is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements using Random forest Algorithm

# Dataset

Pima Indians Diabetes Database
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
All patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

The various Diagnostic variables used are : 
Pregancies column refer to the number of pregnancies of patients.
Glucose column refer to the glucose level of patients.
Blood Pressure refer to the blood pressure of patients.
Skin thickness refers to the thickness of skin of patients
Insulin column refers to the use of insulin in patients
BMI column refers to Body Mass Index of the patients
DiabestesPedigreeFunction indicates the function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Age column refers to the age of the patients
Outcome refers that if the patient have diabetes (1) or not (0)

#MODEL

Model Building using Random forest. 
The random forest is a classification algorithm consisting of many decisions trees. It uses bagging and feature randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.

# Need for the study

The number of people with diabetes rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.
Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.
Over time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.
Adults with diabetes have a two- to three-fold increased risk of heart attacks and strokes (2).
Above statements shows us why diabetes should be taken seriously and treated with importance. Diabetes is a serious health issue that should be treated at the earliest.
